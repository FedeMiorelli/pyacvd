Description: Overview:
        ACVD provides the user with a method of uniformly resampling a surface triangular mesh.  The resampled mesh can be of higher or lower density than the original mesh and handles noisy and non-manifold meshes.
        
        This module was created by translating existing source code written in C++ by S. Valette and J.-M Chassery.  Their work can be found in the link below.  Thanks for your work!
        
        This module can also be used to cluster an existing mesh.  As it uniformly clusters a surface mesh, it is similar to a k-means clustering approach, except applied uniformly to a surface mesh.
        
        Please not that this module is in its early stage of development and will likely have many bugs.  Please report them  on GitHub
        
        
        Requirements:
        This module is dependant on vtk, Cython, Numpy, and Scipy
        
        
        Installation:
            $ pip install ACVD
        
            - or for a single user -
            $ pip install ACVD --user
        
            - or download the source code and execute the following from the download folder: -
            $ python setup.py install
